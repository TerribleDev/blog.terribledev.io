A load of people have been asking me lately how I host my blog. Incase its not apparent, I make 0 dollars on this blog. I refuse to place ads on the page, just to gain pennies of revenue. I do this, not because I don't feel like I shouldn't get paid, but simply because I find ads to be disruptive to the reader. At the end of the day, blogs should have a high signal to noise ratio.

Since I make no money, on this my strategy is about cutting costs. My grandfather use to say "take care of the pounds, because the pennies will take care of themselves." Now since my grandfather is in England, and their dollar is known as the pound, he was telling me to focus even on the small amount of currency.

The first big decision for blogs is what "engine" you are going to use, or if you are going to make your own. These usually fall into 2 categories. Static sites, which are usually when blogs are written in text files, and are compiled into static html, or server rendered blogs such as wordpress. When a request is made to blog that has server rendering, the html is dynamically built in time and delivered to the consumer. Static sites, on the other hand are precomputed and thus are just delivered to the browser.

I won't go into the details on what is better for different scenarios. If you are being cheap, then you will want to use static sites. Static sites are precomputed, which essentially means you just need to serve files to the user. There is no dynamic server to host, you won't need a database, etc. There are a few I like.

<!-- So I know what you are thinking, static sites are just 'better' for page load time. While this is true, they can lack dynamic features that might be important to you, such as adding new blog posts on a schedule, or limiting ip addresses, or even some kind of login/subscription model. -->
