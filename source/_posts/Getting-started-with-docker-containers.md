I've been starting to use docker, more and more recently. As this technology has grown many of my coworkers are getting more, and more interested in docker.
I put together [some materials](https://github.com/TerribleDev/intro-to-docker) and a youtube video which may help some of you getting started with docker. Honestly give me feedback if it helped or not. I might do more tutorials in the future for docker. Docker is such a new technology, and the surface area changes month to month.
